# ParquetEditor
Parquet Editor ( http://parqueteditor.com ) is a comprehensive, browser-based tool for working with Apache Parquet files. It is engineered to be fast, secure, and user-friendly, enabling data professionals to accomplish common tasks without installing additional software.

## Privacy-First Processing
All processing happens inside your browser via WebAssembly. Your files are never uploaded to a server. This ensures complete control over your data, making the tool suitable for sensitive or proprietary datasets.

## Schema Editing
Modify column names, data types, and nullability. The interface is designed to help you edit schemas with confidence while validating changes to avoid common errors.

## Data Manipulation
Add, edit, and delete rows with immediate feedback. Use filters and sorting to focus on the rows you need. When ready, download an updated Parquet file to continue your workflow elsewhere.

## Performance & Large Files
Built on DB running in WebAssembly, Parquet Editor efficiently handles large datasets directly in your browser, reducing latency and the need for infrastructure.

## No Sign-up, No Tracking
Use the tool without creating an account. We focus on a clean, productive experience with minimal friction.
